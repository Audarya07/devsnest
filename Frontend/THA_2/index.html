    Dear Mr. Kramer,
    <p>
        I’m writing today to invite you or another representative from your company to speak at the annual Metropolitan Business Conference, which will be held at <strong>North Branch Hotel</strong>, September 15 - 18, 2020.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lorem, ipsum.</li>
        <li>Lorem, ipsum.</li>
        <li>Lorem, ipsum.</li>
        <li>Lorem, ipsum.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>    
        The theme of our upcoming conference is finding and hiring employees who fit company culture. With the growth that your company has seen in the past five years, I believe you would have much to offer our audience.Link:<a href="#">Click Here!</a>
